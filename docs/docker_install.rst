 

Installation with Docker
--------------------------

Export environment variables as shown in "Sample .bashrc" below.

1. Install Docker and docker-compose if necessary (see "Docker Setup" below) 
2. If using Minio rather than S3, setup Minio (see "Minio Setup" below)
3. Create a bucket for HSDS, using aws cli tools, aws management console, or minio webapp
4. Get project source code: `$ git clone https://github.com/HDFGroup/hsds`
5. Go to admin/config directory: `$ cd hsds/admin/config`
6. Copy the file "passwd.default" to "passwd.txt".  Add any usernames/passwords you wish 
7. Add the DNS for the service to the /etc/hosts file.  E.g. `127.0.0.1  hsds.hdf.test` (can use any valid DNS name) if you running containers directly on the host, or `192.168.99.100  hsds.hdf.test` if using docker machine (use `docker-machine ip` to get the IP address)
8. Create enviroment variables as in "Sample .bashrc" below
9. From hsds directory, build docker image:  `$ docker-compose build` 
10. Start the service `$./runall.sh <n>` where n is the number of containers desired (defaults to 1) 
11. Run `$ docker ps` and verify that the containers are running: hsds_head, hsds_async, hsds_sn_[1-n], hsds_dn_[1-n]
12. Get the external IP for the docker containers (just 127.0.0.1 if running directly on host, otherwise run: `$docker-machine ip`
13. Go to http://hsds.hdf.test/about and verify that "cluster_state" is "READY" (might need to give it a minute or two)
14. Create "/home" folder (TBD)
15. For each other username in the passwd file, create a top-level domain: TBD
16. Install h5pyd on the host: `$pip install h5pyd`
17. Run the client container interactively: `$ ./run_client.sh hsds_test`
18. In the container, run the test suite: `# python testall.py`
19. The test suite will emit some warnings due to test domains not being loaded.  To address see test_data_setup below.
 
Sample .bashrc
--------------
These environment variables will be passed to the Docker containers on start up.

::

    export MINIO_DATA=${HOME}/minio_dat            # only needed for minio installs
    export MINIO_CONFIG=${HOME}/minio_confi        # only needed for minio installs
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=1234567890            # user your AWS account access key if using S3 (Not needed if running on EC2 and AWS_IAM_ROLE is defined)
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=ABCDEFGHIJKL      # use your AWS account access secret key if using S3  (Not needed if running on EC2 and AWS_IAM_ROLE is defined)
    export BUCKET_NAME=hsds.test                   # set to the name of the bucket you will be usings
    export AWS_REGION=us-east-1                    # for boto compatibility - for S3 set to the region the bucket is in
    export AWS_S3_GATEWAY="http://minio:9000"      # if running docker machine set to machine ip 
    export HSDS_ENDPOINT="http://hsds.hdf.test"    # use https protocal if SSL is desired
    # For S3, set AWS_S3_GATEWAY to endpoint for the region the bucket is in.  E.g.: http://s3.amazonaws.com.
    # See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region for list of endpoints.

Minio Setup
-----------

Minio is a docker container you can run on your desktop rather than using S3.  To HSDS Minio just like
works just like the real S3 endpoint.

To setup minio:

1. Create directories for minio data and config files based what the MINIO environemnt varaibles were set to - these can be on any local drive
2. Start Minio container.  From the hsds install directory: `$ run_minio.sh minio`
3. Run: `$ docker logs minio` and verify that minio started correctly.  It shold list the AWS keys specified in the enviornment variables.
4. Go to the minio web app: http://127.0.0.1:9000 or (http://<docker-machine ip>:9000 for docker machine) and sign in using the AWS access keys


Docker Setup
------------

The following are instructions for installing docker on Linux/CentOS.  Details for other Linux distros
may vary.  For OS X, see: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/. 

Run the following commands to install Docker on Linux/CentOS:

::

    $ sudo yum install docker
    $ sudo service docker start
    $ sudo chkconfig --level 300 docker on
    $ sudo groupadd docker # if group docker doesn't exist already
    $ sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
    # log out and back in again (may also need to stop/start docker service)
    $ docker ps  # verify

Install docker-compose.  See: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/


Test Data Setup
---------------

Using the following procedure to import test files into hsds

1. Install h5py: `$ pip install h5py`
2. Install h5pyd (Python client SDK): `$ pip install h5pyd`
3. Download the following file: `$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/hdfgroup/data/hdf5test/tall.h5`
4. In the following steps use the password that was setup for the test_user1 account in place of <passwd>
5. Create a test folder on HSDS: `$ hstouch -u test_user1 -p <passwd> /home/test_user1/test/` 
6. Import into hsds: `$ hsload -v -u test_user1 -p <passwd> tall.h5 /home/test_user1/test/tall.h5`
7. Verify upload: `$ hsls -r -u test_user1 -p <passwd> /home/test_user1/test/tall.h5

Installing Software Updates
---------------------------

To get the latest codes changes from the HSDS repo do the following:

1. Shutdown the service: `$ stopall.sh`
2. Get code changes: `$ git pull`
3. Build a new Docker image: `$ docker-compose build
4. Start the service: `$ ./runall.sh `
