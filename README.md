HSDS (Highly Scalable Data Service) - REST-based service for HDF5 data using object storage
===========================================================================================

Introduction
------------

HSDS is a web service that implements a REST-based web service for HDF5 data stores.
The commercial offering based on this code is known as Kita&trade;.

Quick Start
-------------

Make sure you have Python 3, docker, docker-compose, and aws cli tools installed, then:
   `$runall.sh`
to run the server.

To run test suite, then run:
   `$python testall.py`

See: [docs/docker_install.md](docs/docker_install.md) for complete install instructions.

See: [docs/kubernetes_install.md](kubernetes_install.md) for setup on Kubernetes.

Writing Client Applications
----------------------------

As a REST service, clients be developed using almost any programming language.  The
test programs under: h5serv/test/integ illustrate some of the methods for performing
different operations using Python.

The related project: <https://github.com/HDFGroup/h5pyd> provides a (mostly) h5py-compatible
interface to the server for Python clients.

For C/C++ clients, the HDF REST VOL is a HDF5 library plugin that enables the HDF5 API to read and write data
using HSDS.  See: <https://bitbucket.hdfgroup.org/projects/HDF5VOL/repos/rest/browse>.

Uninstalling
------------

HSDS only modifies the S3 bucket that it is configured to use, so to uninstall just remove
source files, Docker images, and S3 bucket.
