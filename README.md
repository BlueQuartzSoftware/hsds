Introduction
------------
HSDS is a web service that implements a REST-based web service for HDF5 data stores
as described in the paper: http://hdfgroup.org/pubs/papers/RESTful_HDF5.pdf.

Quick Install
-------------

See: :doc:`docs/docker_install.rst`
 
 
Writing Client Applications
----------------------------
As a REST service, clients be developed using almost any programming language.  The 
test programs under: h5serv/test/integ illustrate some of the methods for peforming
different operations using Python. 

The related project: https://github.com/HDFGroup/h5pyd provides a (mostly) h5py-compatible 
interface to the server for Python clients.


Uninstalling
------------

HSDS only modifies the S3 bucket that it is configured to use, so to uninstall just remove 
source files, Docker images, and S3 bucket (or minio directory).
